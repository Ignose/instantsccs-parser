/**
 * The strategy to use for combat for a task, which indicates what to do
 * for each monster.
 *
 * There are two ways to specify in a task what to do for a given monster:
 *   1. Provide a macro directly through .macro(macro, ...monsters)
 *   2. Provide an action through .action(action, ...monsters)
 *
 * An action is a strategy for dealing with a monster that is not fully
 * defined in the task. The possible actions are set with the type parameter A.
 * Actions should typically end the fight.
 *
 * For example, a task may want to banish a monster but not necessarily know or
 * care which banisher is used. Instead, it is best for the engine to determine
 * which banisher to use on the monster. To facilitate this, "banish" can be
 * defined as an action, e.g. with CombatStrategy<"banish">;
 *
 * Each action can be resolved by the engine by:
 *   1. Providing a default macro for the action through ActionDefaults<A>,
 *      which can be done through combat_defaults in Engine options, or
 *   2. Providing a CombatResource for the action through CombatResources<A>.
 *      This is typically done in Engine.customize() by checking if a given
 *      action is requested by the task with combat.can(.), and then providing
 *      an appropriate resource with resources.provide(.).
 *
 * A monster may have both a macro and an action defined, and a macro or action
 * can be specified to be done on all monsters. The order of combat is then:
 * 1. The macro(s) given in .startingMacro().
 * 2. The monster-specific macro(s) from .macro().
 * 3. The general macro(s) from .macro().
 * 4. The monster-specific action from .action().
 * 5. The general action from .action().
 *
 * If an autoattack is set with .autoattack(), the order of the autoattack is:
 * 1. The monster-specific macro(s) from .autoattack().
 * 2. The general macro(s) from .autoattack().
